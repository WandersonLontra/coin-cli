## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

- The CLI uses the API of [https://fixer.io](fixer.io).
- The CLI needs an env file called `configs.env` at the same directory of the executable file built.
- The CLI uses a cache system to store exchange rates locally. Default cache duration is set to 12 hours but you can change it through the env var <TTL_CACHE_IN_HOURS>.

## üîë API Key

This tool requires an API key from a currency exchange rate provider as an environment variable. Checkout the file `configs.env.example`:

```bash
BASE_URL = "https://data.fixer.io/api/latest"

ACCESS_KEY = "<YOUR_API_KEY>"

TTL_CACHE_IN_HOURS = 12

DEV_MODE = false #set true only in development mode
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Build By Docker

First of all, you need change the GOOS parameter in dockerfile according to you Operational System

Use `darwin` for MacOS, `linux` or `windows`

```docker
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=darwin go build -o coin cmd/main.go
```

To build and extract the binary, run these commands:

```

2 - Create a temporary container
